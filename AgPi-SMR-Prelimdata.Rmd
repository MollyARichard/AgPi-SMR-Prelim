## **Introduction**
The analysis of glucocorticoid hormones has become an increasingly popular technique for measuring stress levels of animals facing environmental challenges. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are stress hormones released by the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis when a stressor starts a chain reaction in the body signaling the release of GCs to cope with the stressful situation. These stressors can originate from temperature changes, food shortages, reproductive strategies, social status or anthropogenic disturbances that require an alteration in physiology or behavior to meet basic physiological requirements. There are several hormones (e.g., cortisol, corticosterone) that are excreted during stressful events to aid in mediation.Behavioral responses have been shown to impact escape or avoidance efforts and reproductive success. Physiological responses can affect locomotor performance, immunity levels, reproductive physiology, and metabolism to provide immediate energy to overcome challenges.GCs play an important role in managing metabolism throughout the fluctuating baseline levels (homeostasis) and increased stressed levels (allostasis) by regulating glucose levels to meet energic needs of the various physiological processes.

## **Objectives**
<div style= "float:right;position: relative; top: -60px;">
![Fig 1. Cottonmouth displaying threat response behavior](photo/openmouth.jpg)
</div>
We proposed to assess the relationship between metabolism and corticosterone (CORT) levels by comparing baseline and stress-induced changes in CORT with standard metabolic rates (SMR) in cottonmouth snakes, *Agkistrodon piscivorous*.

* Cottonmouth snakes (n=52) collected from a back-water in Cheatham County, Tennessee
* 100-200μl baseline blood sample to analyze circulating CORT levels from the caudal vein 
* Stress sample collected one hour after the initial sample
* ELISA corticosterone assay kits used to analyze plasma samples
* Metabolic rates measured by rates of oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>)
* Snakes were measured 8 times over a 24-hour period; most level 15 minutes of each 30-minute sample period was used to calculate the rate of gas exchange
* Mean of the three lowest 15-minute measures during the trial period was determined SMR

## **Summary of Results** 
* SMR of these indiviudals is a highly significant function of body mass (p<0.05)
* Accounting for sex, the results are borderline significant with a p-value of 0.0596 (Fig 4)  
* The data were skewed with the large males, a graph of the log values showed data points to have a even distribution (Fig 6) validating the retention of the large male outliars for future analyses
* The Mass Adjusted VO<sub>2</sub> removes the effects of body mass for CORT analyses

Next analysis would be to run global general linear models for a poisson distriubtion: the response variable being CORT level(s), and the effect variables being Mass Adjusted VO<sub>2</sub>, sex, date, time of day, collection time, base temp, stress temp, and the time between samples. 

## **Discussion**
<div style= "float:left;position: relative;">
![Fig 8. Blood draw from the caudel vien of a cottonmouth snake](photo/blood.jpg)
</div>
The boardline significant p-values for sex effects could be due to the extreme sexual body size dimorphism of the species: the largest male weighing 1535g and the largest female weighing 463g. By using the Mass Adjusted VO<sub>2</sub>, we are able to remove the effects of body mass from the proposed analysis of metablic rate and CORT levels. Additional covariates could potential be affecting CORT levels and will be included in future analyses. Extensive research has assessed seasonal influences on stress levels in both ecto- and endo-therms and will be taken into account through date of capture and the time of day as covariates.
</br>
</br>Much of what is known about the relationship between GCs and metabolism is based on theory and applied applications of GCs. This techniques involves either the external application of CORT or the use of an internal CORT pellet to assess the physiological effects of increased CORT levels. The use of these methods however do not take into account the individual variations in CORT response. Jimeno et al found an association between natural produced CORT and metablic rate in zebra finches using similar methods to this study. Assessing the intra-individual variation in this manner can provide additional insights into a more informative relationship between hormonal responses to stressful environments and their energic requirements.
