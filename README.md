Abstract

The analysis of glucocorticoid hormones has become an increasingly popular technique for measuring stress levels exhibited by animals when facing environmental challenges (Buttemer et al 1991, Dupoué et al 2014, Iachetta et al 2018).  Glucocorticoids (GCs) are stress hormones released by the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis (commonly referred to as the stress response system) when an environmental stressor starts a chain reaction in the body signaling the release GCs to cope with the stressful situation (Wingfield et al 1998, McEwen & Wingfield 2003, Romero 2004).  The release of GCs has been shown to affect physiological and behavioral response throughout the body to maintain a state of homeostasis. (Sapolsky et al 2000, Romero 2004).  During stressful events, there are several hormones that are excreted; the primary GC hormone in reptiles is corticosterone (CORT; Greenberg and Wingfield 1987). Studies evaluating the amount of CORT produced often compare a baseline plasma CORT sample to a stress-induced plasma CORT sample (Dupoué et al 2014).  In reptiles these physiological and behavioral responses include increased locomotor performance, decreased immunity levels, and increased metabolism to provide immediate energy to overcome challenges (Saino et al 2003, Miles et al 2007, Jimeno et al 2017). Cottonmouths are a good species to investigate this relationship because they display a conspicuous behavioral threat (stress) response that is indicative of stress, the open-mouth bite-threat. Cottonmouths were blood sampled upon capture and successfully bleed individuals had metabolic phenotype determined via an open stystem respirometry system. An ANOVA will compare individual metabolic rates and the CORT levels to determine if a relationship exists and to assess variation between individuals. A general linear model will evaluate relationships of predictor variables (e.g., mass, sex, body temperature during blood sampling) with the response variable (plasma CORT concentration). 

Respository Description:

This repository is for the preliminary data analysis for a study on the metabolic and stress physiology of cottonmouth snakes.  The code used was formatted using R Markdown and converted to a html which is included. For the analysis, the Standard Metabolic Rate (SMR) data were determined by the volume of oxygen consumed. The plasma Corticosterone (CORT) values are currently dummy numbers used as place holders for the purpose of creating code.
