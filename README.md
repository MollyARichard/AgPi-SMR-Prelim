Abstract

The analysis of glucocorticoid hormones has become an increasingly popular technique for measuring stress levels exhibited by animals when facing environmental challenges.  Glucocorticoids (GCs) are stress hormones released by the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis (commonly referred to as the stress response system) when an environmental stressor starts a chain reaction in the body signaling the release GCs to cope with the stressful situation.  The release of GCs has been shown to affect physiological and behavioral response throughout the body to maintain a state of homeostasis.  During stressful events, there are several hormones that are excreted; the primary GC hormone in reptiles is corticosterone (CORT). Studies evaluating the amount of CORT produced often compare a baseline plasma CORT sample to a stress-induced plasma CORT sample.  In reptiles these physiological and behavioral responses (e.g., locomotor performance, immunity levels, metabolic rate) work to overcome the stressful situation. Cottonmouths are a good species to investigate this relationship because they display a conspicuous behavioral threat (stress) response that is indicative of stress, the open-mouth bite-threat. Cottonmouths were blood sampled upon capture and successfully bleed individuals had metabolic phenotype determined via an open stystem respirometry system. An ANOVA will compare individual metabolic rates and the CORT levels to determine if a relationship exists and to assess variation between individuals. A general linear model will evaluate relationships of predictor variables (e.g., mass, sex, body temperature during blood sampling) with the response variable (plasma CORT concentration). 

Respository Description

This repository is for the preliminary data analysis for a study on the metabolic and stress physiology of cottonmouth snakes.  The code used was formatted using R Markdown and converted to a html which is included. For the analysis, the Standard Metabolic Rate (SMR) data were determined by the volume of oxygen consumed. The plasma Corticosterone (CORT) values are currently dummy numbers used as place holders for the purpose of creating code.
