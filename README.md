# Abstract
Glucocorticoids (GCs) are stress hormones released by the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis when an environmental stressor starts a chain reaction in the body releasing GCs to cope with the stressful situation.  This has been shown to affect physiological and behavioral response throughout the body to maintain a state of homeostasis.  During stressful events, there are several hormones that are excreted; the primary GC hormone in reptiles is corticosterone (CORT). Studies often compare a baseline plasma CORT sample to a stress-induced plasma CORT sample in relation to physiological and behavioral responses (e.g., locomotor performance, immunity, metabolic rate) to identify how an animals cope with the situation.  The objectives of this study are to gain an understanding of the relationship between metabolism and CORT levels by comparing stress-induced changes in CORT with standard metabolic rates in cottonmouth snakes. Cottonmouths are a good species to investigate this relationship because they display a conspicuous behavioral threat (stress) response that is indicative of stress, the open-mouth bite-threat. Cottonmouths were blood sampled upon capture and successfully bleed individuals had metabolic phenotype determined via an open stystem respirometry system. An ANOVA will compare individual metabolic rates and the CORT levels to determine if a relationship exists and to assess variation between individuals. A general linear model will evaluate relationships of predictor variables (e.g., mass, sex, body temperature during blood sampling) with the response variable (plasma CORT concentration). 

#Respository
This repository is for the preliminary data analysis for a study on the metabolic and stress physiology of cottonmouth snakes. The Standard Metabolic Rate (SMR) data were determined by the volume of oxygen consumed. The plasma Corticosterone (CORT) values are currently dummy numbers used as place holders for the purpose of creating code.
